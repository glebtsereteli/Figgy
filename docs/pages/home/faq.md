## 📍 How is Figgy licensed? Can I use it in commercial projects?

Figgy is licensed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/glebtsereteli/Figgy/blob/main/LICENSE), granting you full freedom to use it for any purpose, including commercial projects. The only requirement is to include the `Figgy License.txt` file that comes with the library package.

Mentioning my name (Gleb Tsereteli) in your game's credits would be greatly appreciated and would totally make my day, but it's entirely optional 🙂
