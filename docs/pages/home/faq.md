## I see a new version of Figgy has come out. How do I update to it?
1. Delete the `Figgy` folder from your project.
> [!Important]
> If you've changed any config macros in the `FiggyConfig` script, make sure to copy its contents before deleting the `Figgy` folder and paste them back in after importing the new version before pasting the previous config back in.
> 
> Also keep in mind - the config setup might change between versions, so make sure to pay attention to the release notes.
2. Repeat the [Installation](/pages/home/gettingStarted/#installation) process.
3. You're all set!
